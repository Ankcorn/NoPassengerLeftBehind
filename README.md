# NPLB - No Passengers Left Behind
At [Hacktrain VI](https://hackpartners.com/) we built No Passengers Left Behind. It helps empower station and train staff and make booking rail assistence not a big deal. 

Currently to book rail assistence you need to call up over 24 hours in advance, and you also have to find the right number for each train operator you need to travel with. This causes nearly 75% of people to just book at the station. 

This doesnt just cost the train companies more money. It makes it harded to provide a excelent experiance to the person who needs assistence and means that when there is disruption on the railways (who knew) passengers can fall through the cracks. 

## What does NPLB do for Passengers?

NPLB provides a way for **people** to request assistence on the railways, and then recieve real time updates when train staff are coming to help them to give the passenger the piece of mind that the help they need is coming. i.e. when they are approaching the next station.

There is an example app to show how this works but this will become and api and example components for ticketing apps such as trainline and national rail to integrate so that they can provide integrated access to assistence for their customers.

The system to give passengers live notifications is extremely flexible. It's designed to allow any type of integration depending on the passengers preference (i.e. text message, email, phone number, or app integrations).
