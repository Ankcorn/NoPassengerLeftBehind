# NPLB - No Passengers Left Behind
At [Hacktrain VI](https://hackpartners.com/) we built No Passengers Left Behind. It helps make booking rail assistence not a big deal. 

Currently to book rail assistence you need to call up over 24 hours in advance, and you also have to find the right number for each train operator you need to travel with. This causes nearly 75% of people to just book at the station.
